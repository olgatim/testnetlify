In summer 2018, the Gardener project team asked Kinvolk to execute several
penetration tests in its role as a third-party contractor. We applied our
Kubernetes expertise to identify vulnerabilities on Gardener installations and
to make recommendations.

Some of our findings are now [presented in this article on the Gardener
website](https://gardener.cloud/readmore/insecure).

We presented some of our findings in a joint presentation with [SAP](https://www.sap.com) entitled
[Hardening Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Clusters as a
Service](https://kccncchina2018english.sched.com/event/H2Hd/hardening-multi-cloud-kubernetes-clusters-as-a-service-dirk-marwinski-sap-se-alban-crequy-kinvolk-gmbh)
at [KubeCon 2018 in
Shanghai](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2018/). The [slides in
PDF](https://schd.ws/hosted_files/kccncchina2018english/45/Hardening-Muti-Cloud-7.pdf)
and the [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze1vgh8sjlE) are now
available.

We also presented it at the [Gardener Bi-weekly
Meeting](https://github.com/gardener/documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bi-weekly-meeting),
see the agenda for [Friday 7 Dec
2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1314v8ziVNQPjdBrWp-Y4BYrTDlv7dq2cWDFIa9SMaP4/edit#heading=h.x02wlyulpodh).
