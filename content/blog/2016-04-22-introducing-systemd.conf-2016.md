The [systemd project](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) will be having its 2nd conference—[systemd.conf](https://conf.systemd.io)—from Sept. 28th to Oct. 1st, once again at [betahaus](http://betahaus.com) in Berlin. After the success of last year’s conference, we’re looking forward to having much of the systemd community in Berlin for a second consecutive year. As this year’s event takes place just before [LinuxCon Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe), we’re expecting some new faces.

# Kinvolk’s involvement

As an active user and contributor to systemd, currently through our work on [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/), we’re interested in promoting systemd and helping provide a place for the systemd community to gather.

Last year, Kinvolk helped with much of the organization. This year, we’re happy to be expanding our involvement to include handling the financial-side of the event.

_In general, Kinvolk is willing to help provide support to open source projects who want to hold events in Berlin. Just send us a mail to events@kinvolk.io._

# Don’t fix what isn’t broken

As feedback from last year’s post–conference survey showed, most attendees were pleased with the format. Thus, this year very little will change. The biggest difference is that we’re adding another room to accommodate a few more people and to facilitate impromptu breakout sessions. Some other small changes are that we’ll have warm lunches instead of sandwiches and we’ve dropped the speakers dinner as we felt it wasn’t in line with the goal of bringing all attendees together.

# Workshop day

A new addition to systemd.conf, is the workshop day. The audience for systemd.conf 2015 was predominantly systemd contributors and proficient users. This was very much expected and intended.

However, we also want to give people of varying familiarity with the systemd project the chance to learn more from the people who know it best. The workshop day is intended to facilitate this. The call for presentations (CfP) will include a call for workshop sessions. These workshop sessions will be 2 to 3-hour hands-on sessions covering various areas of, or related to, the systemd project. You can consider it a day of _systemd training_ if that helps with getting approval to attend. :)

As we expect a different audience for workshops than for the presentation and hackfest days, we will be issuing separate tickets. Tickets will become available once the call for participation opens.

# Get involved!

There are several ways you can help make systemd.conf 2016 a success.

## Become a sponsor

These events are only possible with the support of sponsors. In addition to helping the event be more awesome, your sponsorship allows us to bring more of the community together by sponsoring the attendance of those community member that need financial assistance to attend.

See the [systemd.conf 2016 website](https://conf.systemd.io) for how to become a sponsor.

## Submitting talk and workshop proposals

systemd.conf is only as good as the people who attend and the content they provide. In a few weeks we’ll be announcing the opening of the CfP. If you, or your organization, is doing interesting things with systemd, we encourage you to submit a proposal. If you want to spread your knowledge of systemd with others, please consider submitting a proposal for a workshop session.

We’re excited about what this year’s event will bring and look forward to seeing you at _systemd.conf 2016!_
