Today we are pleased to announce Thilo Fromm has joined Kinvolk as Director of Engineering.
He comes to us via Amazon Web Services where he we was a Technical Project Manager on the EC2 team.
Before that he worked at ProfitBricks on virtual machine and cloud-focused Linux kernel projects.

As Director of Engineering, Thilo will be responsible for overseeing our engineering team and its efforts.
He brings with him a valuable combination of technical expertise and project management skills that will be crucial in helping us grow our engineering team and expand our technical service and product offerings.
The result will be increased value to our clients and the open source projects and communities to which we contribute.

Our guiding principle at Kinvolk is to be a valuable contributor to the open-source projects and communities that we participate in.
With the addition of Thilo, the Kinvolk team gains another long-time contributor and supporter of open-source Linux projects.
His passion for free and open-source software mirrors that of the founding team, making Thilo a perfect fit.

Adding Thilo to the team kicks off a very exciting 2019 for Kinvolk.
Over the next few months, we will be announcing new products, services and events.
In order to deliver those, weâ€™ll be announcing further additions to the leadership team in the near future.
Stay tuned for those announcements and other posts by subscribing to our channels.
