_The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?_  
_The same procedure as every year, James!_

As with every year, we’ve reserved the first weekend of February to attend [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/), the premier open-source conference in Europe. We’re looking forward to having drinks and chatting with other open-source contributors and enthusiasts.

But it’s not all fun and games for us. The Kinvolk team has three talks; one each in the [Go](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/go/), [Testing and Automation](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/), & [Linux Containers and Microservices](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/linux_containers_and_microservices/) [devrooms](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/tracks/).

### The talks

We look forward to sharing our work and having conversations about the following topics…

* [gobpf - utilizing eBPF from Go](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/go_bpf/) by Michael in H.1302, Sunday at 10am.
* [Testing web applications with traffic control in containers](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/testing_webapps_with_traffic_control/) by Alban in H.2213, Sunday at 12:20.
* [Running virtual machines in containers](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/virtcontainers/) by Michał in UA2.220, Sunday at 16:10.

If you’ll be there and are interested in those, or other [projects we work on](https://github.com/kinvolk), please do track us down.

We look forward to seeing you there!
