+++

We are looking to expand our team of engineers working on technologies important to modern Linux systems. We focus on the projects that run the world's apps and infrastructure. This has, for example, recently meant working on systemd, the Linux kernel, rkt, and Kubernetes.

If you like the idea of working on a wide range of foundational Linux technologies and joining a supportive team that shares this passion, we’d like to hear from you.

While we mostly work in user-space, the ideal candidate is comfortable spanning the divide between user and kernel-space.

Joining Kinvolk means you’ll be involved in open-source communities, and not only on the technology side. Kinvolk is active in organizing community events and we’d like you to be a part of those.

To get a good idea of what we do, and what you’d be doing at Kinvolk, just take a look. We work in the open and encourage you to browse [our github activity](https://github.com/kinvolk). This will show you what we do and how we go about it.

## Time and location

This is a full-time position, based in Berlin. If you’re not in Berlin, we may be able to help you get here.

_In cases where the applicant has significant experience doing so, we will consider remote work._

## Responsibilities

- Work to improve open-source technologies and client projects built on top of those technologies
- Interface with clients and advise on the best use of open source technologies
- Be a liaison between the client and upstream projects with the goal of getting changes upstreamed
- Stay current on the Linux technology landscape
- Work closely with the rest of the Kinvolk team; communicating across client projects
- Represent Kinvolk at community events

## Skills and experience

People at all experience levels are encouraged to apply. We welcome the opportunity to allow experienced individuals to follow their passion, and those with less experience to develop skills and realize their potential. We believe a team with varied skills and experience creates that best opportunity for everyone to share their knowledge and learn from each other.

### Required

To get the job done, you’re going to need these.

- Knowledge of the Linux kernel API
- Strong in C/C++
- Experience working on active open-source projects
- Ability to work independently
- Good at communicating technical issues and requirements

### Desired, not-required

If you have these skills, awesome! If not, expect to add these while at Kinvolk.

- Commits to system-level Linux projects: Linux, systemd, etc.
- Experience with programming languages like Go, Rust, Erlang, etc.
- Knowledge of container and process isolation technologies
- Good networking know-how
- Speaking German could be useful
