We are looking to expand our team of engineers working on technologies that make up the core of modern, open-source, cloud infrastructure. Among these technologies are Kubernetes, container runtimes like rkt, monitoring systems like Weave Scope and Prometheus, etc.

Kinvolk is a team of developers with experience in open source Linux technologies. Our work has overwhelmingly focused on cloud infrastructure technologies programmed in Go.

We work with some of the most respected companies and engineering teams in the industry to build cutting-edge, open-source technologies. Our clients are at the forefront of developing tools and systems to support running microservice-based architectures. They turn to our team because of our track record of working effectively, and cooperating with upstream projects.

If you like the idea of working on a wide range of technologies at the core of modern cloud systems, contributing to open-source projects, and joining a supportive team that shares this passion, we’d like to hear from you.

Ideal candidate brings prior experience and knowledge and a keen ability to debug and troubleshoot challenging issues.

Joining Kinvolk means you’ll be involved in open-source communities, and not only on the technology side. Kinvolk is active in organizing community events and we’d like you to be a part of those.
